# Solutions for Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com) competition. 

All solutions are implemented in [Julia](https://julialang.org) as a means to learn
more about the language. Solutions may not be pretty or idiomatic but hopefully
both improve over the course of the competition!
