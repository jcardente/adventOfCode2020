# Solutions for Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my solutions for the 
[Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com) competition.

I mainly participated in the competition for fun during COVID but also
used it as an opportunity to get more experience programming in
[Julia](https://julialang.org). My only prior experience with Julia
was a [kaggle competition](https://github.com/jcardente/kaggle_packingSantasSleigh)
back in 2014. The language has evolved a lot since then and I wanted to
explore it more.

I successfully solved all of the puzzles and had a lot of fun in the
process. Some of my favorites where:
