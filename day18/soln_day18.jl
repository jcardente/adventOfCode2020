# PUZZLE:
#
# --- Day 18: Operation Order ---
# 
# As you look out the window and notice a heavily-forested continent
# slowly appear over the horizon, you are interrupted by the child
# sitting next to you. They're curious if you could help them with
# their math homework.
# 
# Unfortunately, it seems like this "math" follows different rules
# than you remember.
# 
# The homework (your puzzle input) consists of a series of expressions
# that consist of addition (+), multiplication (*), and parentheses
# ((...)). Just like normal math, parentheses indicate that the
# expression inside must be evaluated before it can be used by the
# surrounding expression. Addition still finds the sum of the numbers
# on both sides of the operator, and multiplication still finds the
# product.
# 
# However, the rules of operator precedence have changed. Rather than
# evaluating multiplication before addition, the operators have the
# same precedence, and are evaluated left-to-right regardless of the
# order in which they appear.
# 
# For example, the steps to evaluate the expression 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6
# are as follows:
# 
# 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6
#   3   * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6
#       9   + 4 * 5 + 6
#          13   * 5 + 6
#              65   + 6
#                  71
# 
# Parentheses can override this order; for example, here is what
# happens if parentheses are added to form 1 + (2 * 3) + (4 * (5 +
# 6)):
# 
# 1 + (2 * 3) + (4 * (5 + 6))
# 1 +    6    + (4 * (5 + 6))
#      7      + (4 * (5 + 6))
#      7      + (4 *   11   )
#      7      +     44
#             51
# 
# Here are a few more examples:
# 
# - 2 * 3 + (4 * 5) becomes 26.
# - 5 + (8 * 3 + 9 + 3 * 4 * 3) becomes 437.
# - 5 * 9 * (7 * 3 * 3 + 9 * 3 + (8 + 6 * 4)) becomes 12240.
# - ((2 + 4 * 9) * (6 + 9 * 8 + 6) + 6) + 2 + 4 * 2 becomes 13632.
# 
# Before you can help with the homework, you need to understand it
# yourself. Evaluate the expression on each line of the homework; what
# is the sum of the resulting values?
#
# --- Part Two ---
# 
# You manage to answer the child's questions and they finish part 1 of
# their homework, but get stuck when they reach the next section:
# advanced math.
# 
# Now, addition and multiplication have different precedence levels,
# but they're not the ones you're familiar with. Instead, addition is
# evaluated before multiplication.
# 
# For example, the steps to evaluate the expression 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5
# + 6 are now as follows:
# 
# 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6
#   3   * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6
#   3   *   7   * 5 + 6
#   3   *   7   *  11
#      21       *  11
#          231
# 
# Here are the other examples from above:
# 
# 1 + (2 * 3) + (4 * (5 + 6)) still becomes 51.
# 2 * 3 + (4 * 5) becomes 46.
# 5 + (8 * 3 + 9 + 3 * 4 * 3) becomes 1445.
# 5 * 9 * (7 * 3 * 3 + 9 * 3 + (8 + 6 * 4)) becomes 669060.
# ((2 + 4 * 9) * (6 + 9 * 8 + 6) + 6) + 2 + 4 * 2 becomes 23340.
# 
# What do you get if you add up the results of evaluating the homework
# problems using these new rules?
