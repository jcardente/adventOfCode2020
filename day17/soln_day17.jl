# PUZZLE:
#
# --- Day 17: Conway Cubes ---
# 
# As your flight slowly drifts through the sky, the Elves at the
# Mythical Information Bureau at the North Pole contact you. They'd
# like some help debugging a malfunctioning experimental energy source
# aboard one of their super-secret imaging satellites.
# 
# The experimental energy source is based on cutting-edge technology:
# a set of Conway Cubes contained in a pocket dimension! When you hear
# it's having problems, you can't help but agree to take a look.
# 
# The pocket dimension contains an infinite 3-dimensional grid. At
# every integer 3-dimensional coordinate (x,y,z), there exists a
# single cube which is either active or inactive.
# 
# In the initial state of the pocket dimension, almost all cubes start
# inactive. The only exception to this is a small flat region of cubes
# (your puzzle input); the cubes in this region start in the specified
# active (#) or inactive (.) state.
# 
# In the initial state of the pocket dimension, almost all cubes start
# inactive. The only exception to this is a small flat region of cubes
# (your puzzle input); the cubes in this region start in the specified
# active (#) or inactive (.) state.
# 
# The energy source then proceeds to boot up by executing six cycles.
#
# Each cube only ever considers its neighbors: any of the 26 other
# cubes where any of their coordinates differ by at most 1. For
# example, given the cube at x=1,y=2,z=3, its neighbors include the
# cube at x=2,y=2,z=2, the cube at x=0,y=2,z=3, and so on.
#
# During a cycle, all cubes simultaneously change their state
# according to the following rules:
#
# - If a cube is active and exactly 2 or 3 of its neighbors are also
#   active, the cube remains active. Otherwise, the cube becomes
#   inactive.
#
# - If a cube is inactive but exactly 3 of its neighbors are active, the
#   cube becomes active. Otherwise, the cube remains inactive.
#
# The engineers responsible for this experimental energy source would
# like you to simulate the pocket dimension and determine what the
# configuration of cubes should be at the end of the six-cycle boot
# process.
# 
# For example, consider the following initial state:
# 
# .#.
# ..#
# ###
# 
# Even though the pocket dimension is 3-dimensional, this initial
# state represents a small 2-dimensional slice of it. (In particular,
# this initial state defines a 3x3x1 region of the 3-dimensional
# space.)
# 
# Simulating a few cycles from this initial state produces the
# following configurations, where the result of each cycle is shown
# layer-by-layer at each given z coordinate (and the frame of view
# follows the active cells in each cycle):
# 
# Before any cycles:
# 
# z=0
# .#.
# ..#
# ###
# 
# 
# After 1 cycle:
# 
# z=-1
# #..
# ..#
# .#.
# 
# z=0
# #.#
# .##
# .#.
# 
# z=1
# #..
# ..#
# .#.
# 
# 
# After 2 cycles:
# 
# z=-2
# .....
# .....
# ..#..
# .....
# .....
# 
# z=-1
# ..#..
# .#..#
# ....#
# .#...
# .....
# 
# z=0
# ##...
# ##...
# #....
# ....#
# .###.
# 
# z=1
# ..#..
# .#..#
# ....#
# .#...
# .....
# 
# z=2
# .....
# .....
# ..#..
# .....
# .....
# 
# 
# After 3 cycles:
# 
# z=-2
# .......
# .......
# ..##...
# ..###..
# .......
# .......
# .......
# 
# z=-1
# ..#....
# ...#...
# #......
# .....##
# .#...#.
# ..#.#..
# ...#...
# 
# z=0
# ...#...
# .......
# #......
# .......
# .....##
# .##.#..
# ...#...
# 
# z=1
# ..#....
# ...#...
# #......
# .....##
# .#...#.
# ..#.#..
# ...#...
# 
# z=2
# .......
# .......
# ..##...
# ..###..
# .......
# .......
# .......
# 
# After the full six-cycle boot process completes, 112 cubes are left
# in the active state.
# 
# Starting with your given initial configuration, simulate six
# cycles. How many cubes are left in the active state after the sixth
# cycle?
# 
# --- Part Two ---
# 
# For some reason, your simulated results don't match what the
# experimental energy source engineers expected. Apparently, the
# pocket dimension actually has four spatial dimensions, not three.
# 
# The pocket dimension contains an infinite 4-dimensional grid. At
# every integer 4-dimensional coordinate (x,y,z,w), there exists a
# single cube (really, a hypercube) which is still either active or
# inactive.
# 
# Each cube only ever considers its neighbors: any of the 80 other
# cubes where any of their coordinates differ by at most 1. For
# example, given the cube at x=1,y=2,z=3,w=4, its neighbors include
# the cube at x=2,y=2,z=3,w=3, the cube at x=0,y=2,z=3,w=4, and so on.
# 
# The initial state of the pocket dimension still consists of a small
# flat region of cubes. Furthermore, the same rules for cycle updating
# still apply: during each cycle, consider the number of active
# neighbors of each cube.
# 
# For example, consider the same initial state as in the example
# above. Even though the pocket dimension is 4-dimensional, this
# initial state represents a small 2-dimensional slice of it. (In
# particular, this initial state defines a 3x3x1x1 region of the
# 4-dimensional space.)
# 
# Simulating a few cycles from this initial state produces the
# following configurations, where the result of each cycle is shown
# layer-by-layer at each given z and w coordinate:
# 
# Before any cycles:
# 
# z=0, w=0
# .#.
# ..#
# ###
# 
# 
# After 1 cycle:
# 
# z=-1, w=-1
# #..
# ..#
# .#.
# 
# z=0, w=-1
# #..
